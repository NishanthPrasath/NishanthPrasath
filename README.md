## Hello there! 👋

I'm a Data Engineer with a passion for harnessing the power of data to drive meaningful insights and impactful solutions. With over 3.5 years of experience, I specialize in designing, developing, and maintaining end-to-end data pipelines and architectures, enabling organizations to transform data into valuable knowledge.

I believe that data is more than just numbers – it's a transformative force that can unlock a world of possibilities and make a significant difference. I'm constantly seeking opportunities to work with data-driven projects that address real-world challenges and make a positive impact.

Currently, I'm pursuing a Master of Science in Information Systems at Northeastern University to further expand my knowledge and stay at the forefront of the ever-evolving data landscape. I'm also diving deeper into advanced concepts in data engineering and machine learning, and keeping up with the latest trends in the Data & AI space.

### 🛠️ **Tech Stack**

- **Programming Languages:** Python, SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, MongoDB), R, Java, Bash
- **Data Warehousing & ETL:** Snowflake, Redshift, AWS Glue, Azure Data Factory, Talend, Prefect, Airflow, DBT
- **Cloud & Big Data Technologies:** AWS (S3, EC2, Lambda), Azure Blob, Hadoop, Hive, Kafka, Spark, Databricks
- **Data Analytics & Visualization:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK, PyTorch, Matplotlib, Alteryx, Tableau, Power BI
- **DevOps & Other Tools:** Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Git, Jira, ER/Studio, LlamaIndex, LangChain, Terraform

### 🎉 **Fun Fact**

When I'm not deep-diving into data, you can find me brewing the perfect cup of coffee, capturing stunning landscapes through my lens, or planning my next travel adventure.

### 🔗 **Let's Connect!**

Feel free to explore my projects, check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/p-nishanth) profile, or reach out to me if you have any questions or would like to collaborate on data-driven projects.
